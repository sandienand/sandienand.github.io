# Navigating My New Path: A Flexible Plan for GRC Leadership

Following the deep dive into the massive data breach, I’m excited to share a deeper look into the how of my pivot into Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) leadership. This isn't a sudden career change; it's a strategic evolution.

My years in financial services, mastering AML/KYC compliance, process optimisation, and large-scale team leadership, have given me a robust foundation in the **G and R of GRC**. Now, I'm focused on acquiring the rigorous **technical understanding** required for modern cyber-centric risk, which is what the breach analysis proved is missing in too many organisations.

As someone with ADHD, I know a rigid plan is often a recipe for burnout. My approach is designed to be **constructively adaptable**, ensuring curiosity fuels my momentum without derailing my ultimate objective: GRC leadership in the age of AI. I need to manage my energy, not just my time.

### The Three-Part Flexible Strategy

The path is broken down into three phases, designed to be executed flexibly. If I lose focus on one area, I can pivot to another to maintain learning momentum, then circle back.

#### Phase 1: Foundational Deep Dive: Speaking the Language of Tech

**Goal:** Gain **technical literacy** to credibly challenge engineers and interpret audit reports. This means understanding the core building blocks of modern systems, not becoming an expert coder.

- **Cyber Fundamentals:** Core concepts of the CIA Triad, network security, and common vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP).
- **Cloud Architecture:** Basics of AWS/Azure, focusing on Identity and Access Management (IAM), data storage, and encryption.
- **Data Flow Mapping:** Practical skills in visualising how data moves through a system—crucial for enforcing the Integrity Protocol’s **Minimisation** principle.

#### Phase 2: Skill Layering: The GRC Automation Toolkit

**Goal:** Acquire practical skills to build **automated governance controls**—moving GRC from paper-based audits to digital monitoring.

- **Python for GRC:** Scripting basic tasks like risk metrics calculation, data sampling, and automating documentation checks.
- **SQL/NoSQL Basics:** Ability to query and validate data residency, retention, and access logs directly from databases.
- **Audit Automation:** Exploring tools that integrate into Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to check for policy violations *before* code goes live.

#### Phase 3: Execution & Artifact Creation: Proving Competence

**Goal:** Produce **portfolio-ready work\** that demonstrates competence in both governance and technical application.

- **AI Governance Policy:** Drafting a Model Risk Policy for a hypothetical Generative AI use case (e.g., content summarisation).
- **System Security Matrix:** Creating a cross-reference between a major regulation (like the CDR or new AI laws) and the specific technical controls required to enforce it.
- **Simulated Audit:** Performing a dry-run audit of a publicly available open-source project or application, focusing on the **Minimisation** and **Accountability** principles.

## Managing Energy, Not Time

The critical differentiator here is the focus on **Managing Energy, Not Time**. A traditional study schedule demands adherence, which often fails under the pressure of ADHD hyper-focus or distraction.

This flexible structure allows me to lean into my strengths. If the SQL learning feels like a slog, I can switch to the hands-on fun of Python scripting or dive deep into a specific AI policy paper. The learning is layered, meaning every deep dive contributes to the final Execution Phase, regardless of the order.

It's about having multiple high-value paths available at all times. This approach ensures I maintain high output and enthusiasm, keeping my curiosity high and burnout low.

## Next Up: The Technical Dive

The next few posts will document my progress through the **Foundational Deep Dive** of the actual tools, concepts, and mental models I’m using. It's time to put policy into practice. Stay tuned!
