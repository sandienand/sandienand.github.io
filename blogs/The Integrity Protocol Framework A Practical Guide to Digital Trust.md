# The Integrity Protocol Framework: A Practical Guide to Digital Trust

*WIP theory I hope to evolve.* The core triad of GRC is about integrity in design, process, and disclosure.

In the last post, I explained why I’m pivoting from the automatable execution of compliance to the non-automatable governance of technology. If we're to succeed in the age of AI, we need a simple, bedrock set of principles.

At the heart of ethical governance—whether in AI, data, or digital systems—lies a simple triad. This is the **The Integrity Protocol Framework**. It is designed to shift the focus from reactive damage control to proactive, defensible system design.

## Principle 1: Hold Only What You Must

The less data you hold, the smaller your attack surface, the lower your compliance burden, and the greater the respect for individual autonomy.

### Core Idea: Minimise Collection and Retention

- **In Data Privacy:** Collect only the information essential to deliver a service. Avoid the temptation to harvest data that is ‘nice to have’ or may be useful in the future.
- **In AI/Machine Learning:** Train models only on data that is necessary, justified, and ethically sourced. Over-indexing on unnecessary data increases the risk of bias contamination.
- **In Governance:** Avoid building systems that hoard “just in case” information. Challenge every data field with the question: **"What is the operational necessity for this?"**

## Principle 2: Secure What You Hold

Responsibility does not end at collection; it begins there. Trust depends entirely on diligent stewardship.

### Core Idea: Diligent Stewardship and Protection

- **Protect Against Exposure:** Failing to secure data—algorithms, or decision logic—means betraying both your users and your mandate. This goes beyond firewalls; it includes managing APIs, securing internal access, and enforcing least-privilege access.
- **Test and Validate:** Security isn’t a one-time setup; it’s a continuous, adversarial process. Your internal governance must demand regular, rigorous penetration testing, red-teaming, and architecture reviews.
- **Implement Granular Controls:** Apply different levels of security based on data sensitivity. Tokenisation, encryption, and anonymisation must be mandated at the policy level for high-risk data sets.

## Principle 3: Demonstrate Accountability

Integrity is not a claim; it is a demonstrable state. All critical decisions must be auditable, explainable, and justifiable.

### Core Idea: Transparency and Explainability

- **Auditability by Design:** Every significant action by a system, whether automated or human, must leave a clear, immutable audit trail. This is the only way to reconstruct events after an incident or to prove compliance before an audit.
- **Explainability (XAI):** For AI systems, especially those making high-impact decisions (e.g., credit scores, insurance), you must be able to explain the ‘why’ behind the outcome. If you can’t explain an algorithmic decision, you can’t govern it.
- **Clear Ownership:** Accountability cannot be diffused. Organisational policy must clearly name the individual or role responsible for the design, maintenance, and ultimate risk of every digital system.

## Building Digital Trust

These three principles—Minimisation, Security, and Accountability—form a self-reinforcing loop. By holding only what we must, we simplify the challenge of security. By securing what we hold, we prove our trustworthiness. And by demonstrating accountability, we build the public trust necessary for the adoption of sophisticated technology like AI.

Next time, I'll be sharing a more personal update on my GRC career sprint, diving into the adaptive plan I've put in place to acquire the technical skills needed to live up to this framework.
