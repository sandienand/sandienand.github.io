# My GRC Career Sprint, Take 2. The Adaptive Plan for Leadership

Following last week's update, I'm excited to share a deeper dive into the 'how' of my pivot into Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) leadership. This isn't a sudden career change; it's a strategic evolution. My years in financial services, mastering **AML/KYC compliance**, **process optimisation**, and **large-scale team leadership**, have given me a robust foundation in the 'G' and 'R' of GRC. Now, I'm focused on acquiring the rigorous technical understanding required for modern **cyber-centric risk**.

As someone with **ADHD**, I know a rigid plan is often a recipe for burnout. My approach is designed to be **constructively adaptable**, ensuring curiosity fuels my momentum without derailing my ultimate objective. This isn't a static six-month syllabus; it's an adaptive, three-phase sprint.

## The Adaptive Three-Phase GRC Sprint

The core of this "Take 2" sprint is about stacking the *technical* skills (the 'C' for Controls and the *Cyber* in Risk) onto my existing *Governance and Compliance* expertise. Each phase builds on the last, ensuring theory is immediately tested with application.

#### Phase 1: Foundational Technical Mastery (The Core)

This phase is non-negotiable. I need to move from knowing *what* security controls are to knowing *how* they are implemented and measured in a modern context, particularly in the cloud.

- **Core Focus**: **Cloud Security Fundamentals** (AWS/Azure security controls, IaaS/PaaS risk models), **Network Architecture** (understanding the concepts behind **Zero Trust**), and **Cybersecurity Frameworks** (NIST, ISO 27001).
- **Success Metric**: A complete, practical understanding of the **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) and how it informs cloud control design.

#### Phase 2: Application and Automation (The 'R' and 'C')

This stage leverages my background in process optimisation (Power Automate, VBA) and transforms it into GRC automation. Governance shouldn't be manual paper-shuffling; it should be automated, auditable, and repeatable.

- **Core Focus**: **GRC Platforms** (e.g., ServiceNow GRC, AuditBoard), **Audit Logging and Monitoring** to detect control failure, and the principles of **Compliance as Code (CaC)**.
- **Success Metric**: Translating **control failure data** into **actionable risk insights** for senior leadership using data analysis tools (PivotTables, VLOOKUPs) to find true risk signal in the noise.

#### Phase 3: Leadership and Ethical Integration (The 'G' and The Protocol)

The ultimate goal is GRC leadership, which requires translating technical risk into business language and applying my **Integrity Protocol Framework** to emerging technological frontiers.

- **Core Focus**: **AI Governance** (bias, transparency, explainability), **Data Ethics**, and **Strategic Stakeholder Negotiation** (managing the tension between security/risk and business enablement).
- **Success Metric**: A refined theory of the **Integrity Protocol** that explicitly links ethical principles (Hold Only What You Must, Secure What You Hold) to technical mechanisms like Zero Trust.

## Why the Adaptive Approach Matters

The biggest lesson from my previous attempt was that the world of GRC moves too fast for a static, linear syllabus. By using an adaptive model, I can:

- **Timebox Learning**: Spend focused periods on one technical area, then immediately test that knowledge against a **real-world case study** (like a major Australian data breach).
- **Maintain Momentum**: Structure the sprint to accommodate the necessary shift in focus when a high-impact topic (like a new piece of legislation) suddenly demands attention.
- **Ensure Accountability**: Use this platform to document the process, turning my learning journey into a **governance audit trail** for myself.

The pivot is challenging, but the path to leadership is clearer than ever. I'm ready to move past the planning and start sharing the technical insights I'm gaining.
