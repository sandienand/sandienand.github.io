                <h2>Analysing the Jobs & Skills Australia 2050 Forecasts</h2>
                <p>
                    I recently came across the Jobs & Skills Australia (JSA) 2050 Forecasts, and at first, the predictions seemed to make no sense. On the one hand, the forecast suggests that jobs like office clerks, bookkeepers, and even programmers could decline. On the other, roles like cleaners, hospitality staff, and public administration managers are expected to rise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This appears paradoxical. Why would roles traditionally seen as "low-skill" gain prominence while "professional" jobs wane? As I dug deeper, I realised the forecast isn't about skill level—it's about a job's resilience to automation. Jobs that involve repeatable, rules-based tasks—be it drafting marketing copy or producing code—are ripe for $\text{AI}$-driven automation. My past work in finance is filled with examples of this; I've built $\text{Power Automate}$ and $\text{VBA}$ workflows to automate tasks and save teams a huge amount of time. I can speak from experience that $\text{AI}$ will eat this type of work.
                </p>

                <h2>The Vulnerability of Process-Driven Compliance</h2>
                <p>
                    My career in Anti-Money Laundering ($\text{AML}$) and Know Your Customer ($\text{KYC}$) compliance was built on processes. While complex, the core work was ultimately about the meticulous application of defined rules to structured data. This is the automation sweet spot. When a process can be documented in a flow chart, it can eventually be managed by $\text{AI}$.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This insight was uncomfortable: the very processes I had spent years mastering were quickly becoming redundant. The future-proof element was never the execution of the compliance process itself, but the uniquely human elements of ethical judgement, legislative interpretation, and risk foresight.
                </p>

                <h2>The Real Future-Proof Skill: Governance</h2>
                <p>
                    The jobs predicted to grow—managers, health professionals, educators—require tasks that are embodied, unpredictable, and demand high-level emotional and situational intelligence. They resist digitisation and general-purpose $\text{AI}$. The shift in my career is to move from the automatable <strong>execution</strong> of compliance to the non-automatable <strong>governance</strong> of technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm trading the role of a risk <strong>mitigator</strong> through manual process control for the role of a risk <strong>designer</strong> through proactive ethical governance. This means applying my $\text{GRC}$ experience to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Design Accountability:</strong> Ensuring that $\text{AI}$ models and systems are designed with built-in auditability and clear lines of responsibility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ethical Scrutiny:</strong> Applying objective human judgment to novel situations where algorithms fail or create unintended bias.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adaptive Strategy:</strong> Interpreting emerging global regulations (like the $\text{EU AI Act}$) and translating them into agile, local policy.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conclusion: Integrity Over Inertia</h2>
                <p>
                    The $\text{JSA}$ forecast provided the final validation for my pivot: don't optimise for inertia; optimise for integrity and judgement. $\text{AI}$ is going to handle the heavy lifting of repeatable risk-checking. The next generation of $\text{GRC}$ leaders must be the ones setting the guardrails, challenging the assumptions, and ensuring the technology serves human welfare.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This move isn't a rejection of my past; it's a strategic upgrade of my core skill set, moving me higher up the value chain into a role where human integrity remains the most resilient and indispensable asset.
                </p>

                <h2>Next Steps</h2>
                <p>
                    My next post will outline the specific practical framework I use to approach technological governance, which I call <strong>The Integrity Protocol Framework</strong>. I'll break down the core principles of building digital trust.
