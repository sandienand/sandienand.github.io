                <p>
                    Hi, all. Following the deep dive into the massive data breach (Post 3), I’m excited to share a deeper look into the 'how' of my pivot into Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) leadership. This isn't a sudden career change; it's a strategic evolution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My years in financial services, mastering AML/KYC compliance, process optimisation, and large-scale team leadership, have given me a robust foundation in the <strong>'G' and 'R' of GRC</strong>. Now, I'm focused on acquiring the rigorous <strong>technical understanding</strong> required for modern cyber-centric risk, which is what the breach analysis proved is missing in too many organisations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As someone with ADHD, I know a rigid plan is often a recipe for burnout. My approach is designed to be <strong>constructively adaptable</strong>, ensuring curiosity fuels my momentum without derailing my ultimate objective: GRC leadership in the age of AI. I need to manage my energy, not just my time.
                </p>

                <h2>The Three-Part Flexible Strategy</h2>
                <p>
                    The path is broken down into three phases, designed to be executed flexibly. If I lose focus on one area, I can pivot to another to maintain learning momentum, then circle back.
                </p>

                            <strong>Goal:</strong> Gain <strong>technical literacy</strong> to credibly challenge engineers and interpret audit reports. This means understanding the core building blocks of modern systems, not becoming an expert coder.
                        </p>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 pl-4 text-sm text-gray-700 mt-3">

                            <strong>Goal:</strong> Acquire practical skills to build <strong>automated governance controls</strong>—moving GRC from paper-based audits to digital monitoring.

                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 pl-4 text-sm text-gray-700 mt-3">
                            <li><strong>Python for GRC:</strong> Scripting basic tasks like risk metrics calculation, data sampling, and automating documentation checks.</li>

                            <strong>Goal:</strong> Produce <strong>portfolio-ready work*</strong> that demonstrates competence in both governance and technical application.

                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 pl-4 text-sm text-gray-700 mt-3">

                </div>

                <h2>Managing Energy, Not Time</h2>
                <p>
                    The critical differentiator here is the focus on <strong>Managing Energy, Not Time</strong>. A traditional study schedule demands adherence, which often fails under the pressure of ADHD hyper-focus or distraction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This flexible structure allows me to lean into my strengths. If the SQL learning feels like a slog, I can switch to the hands-on fun of Python scripting or dive deep into a specific AI policy paper. The learning is layered, meaning every deep dive contributes to the final Execution Phase, regardless of the order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's about having multiple high-value paths available at all times. This approach ensures I maintain high output and enthusiasm, keeping my curiosity high and burnout low.
                </p>

                <h2>Next Up: The Technical Dive</h2>
                <p>
                    The next few posts will document my progress through the <strong>Foundational Deep Dive</strong>—the actual tools, concepts, and mental models I’m using. It's time to put policy into practice. Stay tuned!
