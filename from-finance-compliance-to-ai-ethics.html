                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800">How I'm Moving from Financial Integrity to Technological Integrity</h2>
                <p>
                    For years, I built a career on a foundation of discipline, risk mitigation, and strategic leadership. As a Team Leader and Manager in the finance and compliance sector, my work was all about structure. I led teams, streamlined processes with tools like Power Automate, and ensured adherence to complex regulatory frameworks like Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC). There was a deep sense of accomplishment in a job well done, in the tangible results and the clear path of progression. But beneath the satisfaction of achievement, a different kind of ambition was growing—a desire for a purpose that resonated more deeply with my values. I started to see the world's most critical challenges looming in a new area.
                </p>

                <h2>The Uncomfortable Truth of Compliance</h2>
                <p>
                    In my previous roles, I spent much of my time ensuring compliance—making sure we weren't breaking the rules. While vital, this work often felt reactive and narrow. The goal was to minimise risk, not necessarily to maximise positive impact or ethical design. I saw compliance become a check-box exercise, a cost centre focused on the <strong class="text-indigo-600 italic">letter</strong> of the law rather than the <strong class="text-indigo-600 italic">spirit</strong> of integrity. This is not governance; it’s box-ticking. I believe true governance should be <strong>proactive, principle-driven, and designed for human welfare</strong>.
                </p>

                <h2>The Critical Pivot: Integrity vs. Policy</h2>
                <p>
                    My shift is rooted in redefining the core value. Financial integrity (AML/KYC) is about ensuring the system isn't exploited by bad actors. <strong>Technological integrity (AI Ethics) is about ensuring the system itself doesn't become a bad actor.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The skills, however, are profoundly transferable:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-4 mb-6 text-gray-700">
                    <li><strong>From AML/KYC to AI:</strong> Interpreting ambiguous regulations and applying objective judgement to complex, novel situations.</li>
                    <li><strong>From Risk Mitigation to Algorithm Auditing:</strong> Identifying systemic failure points where bias or opacity can lead to harm.</li>
                    <li><strong>From Process Optimisation to Ethical Design:</strong> Building controls and accountability into the system from the start (privacy by design).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I realised I wasn't changing fields; I was simply applying my core <strong>integrity protocol</strong> to a more challenging and future-defining domain.
                </p>

                <h2>The New Frontier: AI Ethics and Governance</h2>
                <p>
                    AI is the new engine of global society, and it’s accelerating faster than our ability to govern it. The risks are profound: bias, opacity, job displacement, and systemic injustice. This is where my GRC experience becomes critical. Governance is needed now, more than ever, not just to react to AI failures but to embed ethical guardrails into their very design. I want to be a part of building the system that ensures technological power is wielded responsibly.
                </p>

                <h2>My Adaptive Strategy: Building the Bridge</h2>
                <p>
                    To make this leap, I've developed a two-part approach:
                </p>
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 pl-4 mb-6 text-gray-700">
                    <li><strong>Technical Rigor:</strong> I’m focusing on data science and machine learning fundamentals to understand <em>how</em> AI makes decisions, not just <em>what</em> decisions it makes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regulatory Depth:</strong> Deep diving into emerging frameworks like the EU AI Act, the NIST AI Risk Management Framework, and Australia's own digital trust initiatives.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This hybrid approach—bridging my <strong>Compliance/Risk</strong> past with a <strong>Technical/Ethical</strong> future—is my path to a leadership role in GRC for the digital age.
                </p>

                <h2>Next Steps</h2>
                <p>
                    This post marks the start of this public journey. My next piece will explore the counter-intuitive reality of <strong>The Paradox of the Future-Proof Job</strong>, inspired by the JSA 2050 Forecasts, which further validates the need for this career pivot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Integrity Protocol</strong> is not just a brand; it’s a commitment. I’m committed to building a career that prioritises <strong>integrity over inertia</strong>, and I invite you to follow along.
